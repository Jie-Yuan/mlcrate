# mlcrate
A collection of handy python tools and functions, mainly for ML and Kaggle.

The methods in this package aren't revolutionary, and most of them are very basic. They are largely bunch of 'macro' functions which I often end up rewriting across multiple projects, all in one place and easily accessible to make my life easier and let me write code faster in the future. Hopefully, they can be some use to others in the community too.

This package has been tested with Python 3.5+, but should work with all versions of Python 3. Python 2 is not officially supported (although most of the functions would work in theory.)
